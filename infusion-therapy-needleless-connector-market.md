<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infusion Therapy Needleless Connector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Fluid Displacement</li><li>Negative Fluid Displacement</li><li>Neutral Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Infusion Therapy Needleless Connector market is categorized into three types based on fluid displacement mechanisms: Positive Fluid Displacement, Negative Fluid Displacement, and Neutral Displacement. Positive Fluid Displacement connectors push fluids forward during injection, minimizing blood reflux. Negative Fluid Displacement connectors create a vacuum effect that helps prevent backflow but can increase the risk of infection. Neutral Displacement connectors allow for fluid exchange without significant pressure changes, reducing the risk of occlusions and maintaining a stable environment in the catheter.</p></p>
