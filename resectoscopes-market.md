<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resectoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Resectoscopes</li><li>Bipolar Resectoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resectoscopes are specialized medical instruments used primarily in urology and gynecology for surgical procedures such as tissue resection. The market is divided into two main types: unipolar and bipolar resectoscopes. Unipolar resectoscopes utilize a single active electrode for cutting and coagulating tissue, often requiring electrolytic fluid. In contrast, bipolar resectoscopes use two electrodes, allowing for tissue removal with minimal thermal spread, improving safety and reducing complications. Both types cater to specific surgical needs, influencing their market demand and applications.</p></p>
